To run facebook and twitter bots:

copy the "classes" folder in home to SSWS/sensite/Sensite/build/web/WEB-INF if it is not already there

run netbeans to update the builds of sensitetwitterpost and sensitefacebook, if needed

run from SSWS/sensite/Sensite:

java -cp build/web/WEB-INF/classes com.queries.SensiteFacebook

(in a different shell)
java -cp build/web/WEB-INF/classes com.queries.SensiteTwitterPost
